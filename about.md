Hello World! I am Parth Patel, a final year undergraduate student in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. I am excited about the recent surge in the use of artificial intelligence (across various domains) worldwide. At the centre of this revolution are deep neural networks, achieving the state of the art in various tasks like object detection, speech recognition, image generation, etc. I have read blogs of many people (like colah.github.io) and found them incredibly useful in understanding different neural network concepts in a simple manner. My main aim through this blog is to give back to the community and share my thoughts and understanding with everyone.

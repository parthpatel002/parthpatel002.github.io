Hello World! I am Parth Patel, a final year undergraduate student in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. 

I am super excited about the recent surge in the use of artificial intelligence (across various domains) worldwide. I strongly believe that this field has the potential to change the world. But at the same time, it's hard to catch up for beginners. My reasons to start this blog are dual:
+ This would help me reinforce my knowledge (as the popular saying goes - "Teaching is the best form of learning") and also capture a snapshot of my thoughts throughout my machine learning journey.
+ I have read blogs of many people (like [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io), [Chris McCormick](https://mccormickml.com), [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/about/), [Max Pechyonkin](https://pechyonkin.me), and many more...) and found them incredibly useful in my short journey of machine learning so far. This blog will help me share my thoughts and understanding with everyone, while at the same time paving way for frank and open discussions.
